# Code-B-Internship

# Overview
This project aims to build a Machine Learning model to detect phishing websites based on various features extracted from URLs. Phishing websites are fraudulent sites designed to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is dataset_phishing.csv, which contains multiple features representing characteristics of URLs and their classification as phishing or legitimate.

# Features in the dataset:
•	URL-based features: Characteristics derived from the URL structure.
•	Domain-based features: Information related to domain registration and age.
•	Content-based features: Information extracted from the website's content and scripts.
•	Label: Indicates whether a website is phishing (1) or legitimate (0).
